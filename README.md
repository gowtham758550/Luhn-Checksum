# Luhn Algorithm
It is a check sum algorithm to validate a credit card 
number.
Not only credit card number some, identification numbers 
issued 
by the government organisations follow this luhn 
algorithm.
    
Some examples such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, 
National Provider Identifier numbers in the United States, 
Canadian Social Insurance Numbers, Israel ID Numbers, 
South African ID Numbers, Greek Social Security Numbers, 
and survey codes appearing on McDonald's, Taco Bell, and 
Tractor Supply Co. receipts. 

And the code identify the card issuer.
